# Facial-Expression-Recognition
AI / ML project - build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras to recognize facial expressions. Using the infamous Tensorflow-Keras library, I attempt to create a machine learning model that outputs the expression depicted on an image or video.

### Goal: The model should predict facial expressions made throughout the video. (i.e. Happy, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, etc.)
